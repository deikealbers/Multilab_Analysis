I could imagine simply using the button to change the automation level between the 3 settings would be enough for me. 

Additionally I felt like the the perfect solution for alerting when a need between automated and manual driving is needed wasn't fully achieved.  In the first scenario there was not enough feedback to tell me that I needed to take over control - I could easily imagine not noticing it in time if I were fully distracted.  The second scenario with the beep was alarming, and made me act immediately, but also with some panic.  I believe I hit the breaks immediately, and perhaps that was not needed or could have even been dangerous if i were in traffic.","I could imagine the entire background color of the control area changing colors - it remained black the entire time and it could have turned blue or green for automated driving and turned red if I needed to take action.  Additionally tactitle notification in the stearing wheel or or seat might be intresting as well.  I found the lights on the stearing wheel to not be bright enough during the day light to be of much use, and perhaps there could have been a larger lighting area on the stearing wheel for this type of feedback.","overall I enjoyed the experience.

I understand this to mean that the interface keeps the driver from periodically evaluating the traffic situation outside the vehicle. In my experience the best way to minimize risk for all parties on the roads is to behave predictably. Changing driving modes seems like something that should happen only when a driver can consider both the suggestions of the vehicle, and the traffic situation outside the vehicle.

For example, as a following vehicle, I would be surprised and forced to react if a vehicle shifts up when an uphill slope starts to level out but the top of the hill is not necessarily in view yet, whereas from my perspective a normal driver would continue maintaining their climbing speed until cresting the hill if they are aware that there are other vehicles maintaining the exact same climbing speed directly behind them. Another example would be when traveling on a two lane highway and deciding to start cruise. It may be safe to enable cruise in either lane when no vehicles are immediately in front of the drivers vehicle, but a normal driver would not do so if, in the far distance, there are big rigs overtaking each other and taking up the passing lane for what the driver knows is an extended time. As a following vehicle, I would also not expect the drivers vehicle to be on cruise and their attention off the traffic situation and would expect them to allow a pass if I am approaching the overtaking rigs at a higher speed than they are.

As a lifelong motorcyclist, it is hard to imagine traffic being safe for me when a drivers attention is away from the road for any extended period of time. Minor cues like a quick turn of the head to check a side-view mirror are life-saving, even if the driver in the end does not decide to perform a lane change. Although it should be enough for an automated system to warn the driver of my presence, in my experience it far safer for the motorcyclist themselves to take predictable cues from the driving behavior of the vehicle ahead and choose to avoid being in their vicinity while they adjust their driving posture.",2,1,4,4,1,1,0,,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,,,2,,1,0,,1,1,1,I thought icons belong to the steering wheel and not the system,,4,,0,NA,,1,1,0,,1,,,4,,0,NA,,1,1,1,,,2,,0,NA,,1,0,0,,1,I think I can take hands of because of the active lane detection,,0,,1,5,,2,,0,0,5,"I dont know why the car braked but after that the level was not available anymore , ",,2,,0,NA,,0,0,2,,,2,,1,2,,0,0,1,,,4,,0,NA,,1,1,0,,1,,,0,,1,6,,0,,0,0,0,,1,Not sure whether the car automatically decelerates even before I took over ,,4,,1,2,,1,1,0,NA,1,,,0,,1,5,,0,,0,0,0,,1,,,5,3,7,1,3,1,5,1,2,2,4,1,3,1,3,4,5,7,4,1,3,4,6,2,3,4,5,2,6,5,4,6,4,4,2,4,2,6,2,5,4,3,The HMI seemed to be well aware of the lane markings and maintained speed predictably.,"The HMI asked me as a driver to take control without automatically deactivating the automated driving mode. My instincts as a driver would be ignore the HMI and focus on the road situation ahead from the moment that the HMI asks me to take over, so this is very unpredictable for me, and the car could also appear unpredictable to other drivers if the automated mode is not immediately off.","When flashing the ""emergency brake"" warning immediately after asking me as a driver to take over, it was not clear whether I was supposed to apply the brake or whether the car was doing so automatically. In this instance, if the car were to brake and warn me that it was doing so for an obstacle ahead, I would trust the HMI to have seen the obstacle I may not see.

Another area of improvement could be the position of the warnings. The large lane keeping indicator in the middle of the screen did not change when the warnings were issued over the radio portion of the screen, although this is where a drivers eyes may be instinctually drawn. The warnings might fit better in place of the unchanging indicator.","Overall the system was quite easy to use. It felt strange for the system to indicate that automated driving was available when I was in manual mode because the system requires switching through assisted mode to get to automated mode. I would expect this to occur only when the driver has requested the vehicle to assist them already, so there is only one switch necessary to get there.",1,1,0,2,1,3,4,0,1,3,2,2,4,0,2,,

Obviously, it was clear from the bottom of the screen which mode one was in, but since it was progressive, someone might mistake that they are in assisted driving instead of automated driving.

Otherwise it would be too much like 2001 Space Odyssey in which HAL is addressing the astronauts. I do think that some voice reminders are important, however.","I think that automated driving is a super interesting possibility, and it is intriguing to see how the issue is being explored from a user experience standpoint, but I think that the system needs to be super clear to the driver as to which mode in which they are driving. If it isn´t super clear to the driver that they aren't in one mode or another, that could obviously lead to problems."
