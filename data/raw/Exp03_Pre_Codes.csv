I understand this to mean that the interface keeps the driver from periodically evaluating the traffic situation outside the vehicle. In my experience the best way to minimize risk for all parties on the roads is to behave predictably. Changing driving modes seems like something that should happen only when a driver can consider both the suggestions of the vehicle, and the traffic situation outside the vehicle.

For example, as a following vehicle, I would be surprised and forced to react if a vehicle shifts up when an uphill slope starts to level out but the top of the hill is not necessarily in view yet, whereas from my perspective a normal driver would continue maintaining their climbing speed until cresting the hill if they are aware that there are other vehicles maintaining the exact same climbing speed directly behind them. Another example would be when traveling on a two lane highway and deciding to start cruise. It may be safe to enable cruise in either lane when no vehicles are immediately in front of the drivers vehicle, but a normal driver would not do so if, in the far distance, there are big rigs overtaking each other and taking up the passing lane for what the driver knows is an extended time. As a following vehicle, I would also not expect the drivers vehicle to be on cruise and their attention off the traffic situation and would expect them to allow a pass if I am approaching the overtaking rigs at a higher speed than they are.

As a lifelong motorcyclist, it is hard to imagine traffic being safe for me when a drivers attention is away from the road for any extended period of time. Minor cues like a quick turn of the head to check a side-view mirror are life-saving, even if the driver in the end does not decide to perform a lane change. Although it should be enough for an automated system to warn the driver of my presence, in my experience it far safer for the motorcyclist themselves to take predictable cues from the driving behavior of the vehicle ahead and choose to avoid being in their vicinity while they adjust their driving posture."
